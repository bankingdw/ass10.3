Calculate maximum temperature from temperature_data table corresponding to those years which have at least 2 entries in the table.

SELECT YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date,'dd-mm-yyyy'))) as date, MAX(temperature) as max_temp FROM temperature_data GROUP BY YEAR(FROM_UNIXTIME(UNIX_TIMESTAMP(date,'dd-mm-yyyy'))) HAVING COUNT(date)>=2;
